1. I created a virtual environment
2. In the virtual environment I installed django and started its project.
3. Then I created app1.
4. Then I created templates foledr inside the main registration folder and added three html templates there.
5. After this I went to app1/views.py and created 3 empty views.
6. Then I added the views.py to urls.py so that these functions can display the page. It is called routing the urls
7. I rendered the singup page in views.py there is some problem at its line 160. It is becuase of linking those pages
8. I added the login.html to both urls.py and views.py and it solved the problem that occured in the previous step.
9. makemigrations (python manage.py makemigrations), migragte (python manage.py migrate), and createsuperuser (python manage.py createuperuser) => username - Maitry, email - maitryparikh23@gmail.com, password - Hello123
10. Logged in to django admin by http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin entered the above username and password. Came to views.py to manage user data
11. The signup page returns some data to the view when we press the submit button. This data is captured in the variables. I tested that comming correctly with a print. This
12. Now I transeferred the data from signup to database through models.py (from django.contrib.auth.models import User)
13. the users are now getting created. Then i added a redirect to direct the user to login page after creating an account.
14. There is a small mistake in the signup page. Even if the passwords don't match, the user will be created. I added an if condition in the respective view.

----------Here I took a break. Because I need to transfer this to mysql database----------
